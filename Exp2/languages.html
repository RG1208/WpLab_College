          <h2 class="Level">Low-Level Languages</h2>
          <p class="Intro">
            Low-level languages are closer to the hardware and offer
            fine-grained control over system resources.
          </p>
          <ul class="ul">
            <li class="list">
              <strong>Assembly Language:</strong> Used for hardware-level
              programming and embedded systems. Offers detailed control over the
              CPU and memory.
            </li>
            <li class="list">
              <strong>Machine Language:</strong> Binary code that is directly
              executed by the computer's CPU. It's not typically written
              manually but is the lowest level of code execution.

        <h2 class="Level">High-Level Languages</h2>
        <p class="Intro">
          High-level languages provide abstraction from hardware, making it
          easier to write and maintain code.
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="list">
            <strong>Procedural Languages:</strong> Focus on sequences of
            procedures or functions. Examples include C and Pascal. They are
            used for system and application programming.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <strong>Object-Oriented Languages:</strong> Based on objects and
            classes, supporting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
            Examples include Java and Python. They are ideal for large-scale
            applications and software development.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <strong>Functional Languages:</strong> Treat computation as the
            evaluation of mathematical functions and avoid changing state.
            Examples include Haskell and Lisp. They are used for mathematical
            computations and concurrent programming.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <strong>Declarative Languages:</strong> Focus on what the program
            should accomplish rather than how. Examples include SQL and HTML.
            SQL is used for database queries, while HTML is used for web
            markup.

        <h2 class="Level">Scripting Languages</h2>
        <p class="Intro">
          Scripting languages are often used for automating tasks and writing
          small programs.
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="list">
            <strong>JavaScript:</strong> Primarily used for client-side web
            development to create interactive web pages.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <strong>Python:</strong> Known for its readability and
            versatility, used in web development, data analysis, artificial
            intelligence, and automation.

        <p class="Intro">
          Some languages are designed for specific tasks and industries.
        </p>
        <ul class="ul">
          <li class="list">
            <strong>SQL:</strong> Used for managing and querying relational
            databases, making it essential for data retrieval and
            manipulation.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <strong>MATLAB:</strong> Used for numerical computing and
            simulations, often in engineering and scientific research.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            <strong>R:</strong> Designed for statistical computing and
            graphics, used extensively in data analysis and statistical
            modeling.
