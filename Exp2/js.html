      <p>
        JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, versatile programming language
        primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic features to web
        pages. It runs in web browsers, enabling functionalities like form
        validation, animations, and real-time updates without requiring a page
        reload. JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
        programming styles. Key features include variables, functions, objects,
        and asynchronous operations with promises and async/await. It integrates
        seamlessly with HTML and CSS, enhancing user experience by manipulating
        the Document Object Model (DOM) and handling events. JavaScript also
        powers server-side development with Node.js, making it a cornerstone of
        modern web development.
