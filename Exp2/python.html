        object-oriented, and functional programming. Key features include
        dynamic typing, automatic memory management, and an extensive standard
        library. Its versatile nature makes it suitable for web development,
        data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and
        automation. Popular frameworks and libraries like Django, Flask, Pandas,
        and TensorFlow extend its capabilities, contributing to Python's
        widespread use in various industries and research fields.
