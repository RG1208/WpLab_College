      <p>
        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language used to style and lay out web pages. It controls the appearance of HTML elements by applying styles such as colors, fonts, and spacing. CSS uses selectors to target specific elements and properties to define their look. Key concepts include the box model (content, padding, border, margin), Flexbox, and Grid for layout, and media queries for responsive design. CSS enhances user experience by allowing precise control over visual presentation, making websites visually appealing and adaptable to various devices. It is essential for creating modern, attractive, and functional web interfaces.
