      <h2>What is C++?</h2>
      <p>
        C++ is a versatile, high-performance programming language that extends the C language with object-oriented features. It supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from system/software development to game programming and real-time simulations. Key features include classes and objects, inheritance, polymorphism, templates, and exception handling. C++ allows for low-level memory manipulation, giving developers control over system resources. Its Standard Library provides powerful tools for data structures, algorithms, and input/output operations. C++ is widely used in industries requiring high efficiency and speed, including software development, game design, and embedded systems.
