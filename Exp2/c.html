      <h2>What is C?</h2>
      <p>
       C is a foundational, high-level programming language developed in the 1970s. Known for its efficiency and portability, it provides low-level access to memory and system resources, making it ideal for system programming, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. C features a straightforward syntax and supports structured programming with functions, variables, and control flow statements. Its key strengths include direct memory manipulation via pointers, a rich set of operators, and minimal runtime overhead. The C Standard Library offers essential functions for input/output, string handling, and memory management. Despite its age, C remains widely used and influential in modern programming.
